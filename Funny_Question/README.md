🧭 How It Works

When the user hovers over a button, a message appears and a sound plays.

When the mouse moves away, the original button text and state are restored.

Different buttons trigger different audio effects.

🛠️ How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in any browser.

Make sure the audio files (funny.wav and sad.wav) are in the same folder.

Hover over the buttons and enjoy the interaction!

✨ Future Improvements (Optional)

Add background music or more sound effects.

Make the UI more visually appealing with gradients and transitions.

Add more choice buttons or animations.
